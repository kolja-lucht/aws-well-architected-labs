Well-Architected Reviews are conducted per [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html). A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.

1. Click the **Define Workload** button on the landing page:
